    "# What is `python`?\n",
    "- Python is an **interpreted**, **object-oriented**, **high-level** programming language with **dynamic semantics**.\n",
    "- Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. \n",
    "- Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. \n",
    "- Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.\n",
    "- The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is **no compilation step**, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an **exception**. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, **often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective**.\n",
